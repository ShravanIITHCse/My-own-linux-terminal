mycp:
    Usage: mycp [OPTION] SOURCE DEST
    Copy SOURCE to DEST

    Arguements that I have embbeded in my code given

    1) -r : copy directories recursively

    2) -n : do not overwrite an existing file

    3) -f : if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again 
            (this option is ignored when the -n option is also used)

    4) -i : prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)
